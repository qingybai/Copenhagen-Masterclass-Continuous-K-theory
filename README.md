## Overview
This file collects the distribution of  workload for the volunteers of live LaTeXing group of the 2024 Copenhagen masterclass on Continuous K-theory. Put your name after a talk if you plan to live-TeX that one, it's OK if 2 people are working on the same talk, but ideally should not overlap too much (and you should communicate with each other if you are working on the same talk).

Everyone is welcome to clean up the details of a lecture, but we recommend that you talk to the live-Texer before suggesting an update.
