## Overview
This file collects the distribution of workload for the volunteers of live LaTeXing group of the 2024 Copenhagen Masterclass on Continuous K-theory. Feel free to edit this file and put your name after a talk if you plan to live-TeX that one, it's OK if 2 people are working on the same talk, but ideally should not overlap too much (and you should communicate with each other if you are working on the same talk). Please follow the naming convention of the folder.
